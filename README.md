NissanConsult
=============
Almost guaranteed to be somewhat broken. I'm bad at python, and I'm too lazy to walk it out to my car to test it.

For those of you brave enough to try, I made this work with a USB serial cable to the Consult interface, running it on a raspberry pi.


Got a lot of inspiration from https://github.com/Crim/Arduino-Nissan-Consult-Library . If you want better code, look at his! It's a lot better.....

Licensed under the GPLv2 because it worked at the time. If it actaully prevents you from using this well, I'm open to relicensing.
